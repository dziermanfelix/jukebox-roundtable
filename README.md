# Jukebox Roundtable

Tired of wrestling over the aux cord? What about hearing that awful sound when you unplug your device so you can hand the cord to your uncle Ricky? It's time to use Jukebox Roundtable.

Jukebox Roundtable is a collaborative music listening app that simplifies group playback. One central Spotify player connects to a source, and users join the jukebox to queue their songs. The backend ensures fair track rotation, playing each user's next track when it's their turnâ€”no skips, no interruptions. Yes, that means everyone has to endure Uncle Rickyâ€™s terrible song choices. But donâ€™t worryâ€”your turn is coming soon.
